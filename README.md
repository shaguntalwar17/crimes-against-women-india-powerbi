# Crimes Against Women in India – Power BI Analysis  
**Unheard Voices: A Data Story**

## Project Overview
Crimes against women represent one of the most critical social challenges in India.  
This project presents a **data-driven analytical study** of crimes against women across **national, state and district levels** using interactive **Power BI dashboards** and a detailed analytical report.

The objective is not only to visualize numbers but to **amplify unheard voices**, identify **systemic patterns** and support **evidence-based decision-making** for safety, policy and social accountability.

## Objectives
- Analyze long-term trends in crimes against women across India  
- Identify high-burden **states and district-level hotspots**  
- Compare crime categories such as rape, domestic violence, kidnapping, cyber crimes, acid attacks, dowry deaths and human trafficking  
- Highlight **severity patterns and emerging risks** (e.g. cyber crimes and mental health links)  
- Enable **data-informed interventions** rather than assumption-driven narratives  

---

## Scope of Analysis
The dashboard and report provide a **three-level analytical view**:

### National Level
- Total crimes and category-wise distribution  
- Year-wise trends (2016–2022)  
- Age-based vulnerability patterns  
- Rising cyber crime trends  

### State Level
- Crime severity index and total crime rankings  
- State-wise distribution of domestic violence, rape, kidnapping and trafficking  
- Dowry deaths and acid attack patterns  
- Correlation between cyber crimes and abetment of suicide  

### District Level
- District crime hotspots and rankings  
- Micro-level comparison of kidnapping vs assaults  
- District-wise rape trends and domestic violence concentration  
- Identification of extreme-risk districts requiring targeted action

## Key Insights
- **Crimes against women show a persistent upward trend** indicating structural and systemic challenges rather than isolated incidents.  
- **Domestic violence emerges as the largest contributor** highlighting risks within private spaces alongside public threats.  
- A small group of states and districts consistently appear as **high-burden hotspots** demanding focused intervention rather than uniform policy.  
- **Cyber crimes demonstrate a worrying association with severe mental health outcomes** reinforcing the need for digital safety and psychological support frameworks.  
- Vulnerability spans **all age groups** emphasizing that no demographic is immune.

## Data Notes & Limitations
- The analysis is based on **reported crime data**, which may be affected by under-reporting and regional reporting practices.  
- Values represent **aggregated patterns**, not absolute ground truth.  
- Composite indicators (e.g. Crime Severity Index) are analytical constructs intended for **comparison and prioritization**, not legal judgment.

Transparency around these limitations is essential for ethical and responsible data analysis.

## Why This Project Matters
Behind every data point lies a lived experience.  
This project demonstrates how **data analytics can move beyond dashboards** to support **policy prioritization, public awareness and social impact**.  
It reflects the belief that **numbers should not silence stories—but strengthen them**.
